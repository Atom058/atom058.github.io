# You don't need a blockchain
An re-implementation of the now-famous "You don't need a Blockchain" flowchart.

The rewrite was done to make it simpler to change the choices presented to the user, by migrating the original site built with react to something with less dependencies.

# Acknowledgements
Based on the original work by [brucemd](https://github.com/brucemacd/You-Dont-Need-A-Blockchain/), but rewritten in plain HTML/CSS/JQuery.

The base of the flowchart is the NIST flowchart, [available here](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2018/NIST.IR.8202.pdf).
